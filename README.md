# Reignite Render

Oscar Mari Jurado. Sheffield Hallam University - Computer Science for Games.

Elaboration:
- In order to create real-time scenes with better quality and realism but allowing hardware setups with
lower power to render them I will develop a render/engine from scratch, using VulKan API. The render
will have the basic features of lighting, shadowing and materials but data-oriented and prepared for
further development on ray tracing. Since then, new features could be added or even improved by
adding researched ray tracing features.

Project Aims:
- VulKan API development.
- Multithreading / Scheduling.
- Oriented Data Design.
- Deferred shading rendering method.
- Physically Based Rendering.
- Post-processing.
- Ray tracing.
- Different scenes showing the render features.
- Each benchmark will show the features and quantities on the scene.
- Scenes with instanced big quantities of objects with benchmarking purposes.
- Benchmarking objective: Res: 1920x1080p / FPS: 30 (minimum) - 60 (optimum).
